A framework for [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy) working with [os-go-rq](https://github.com/cfhamlet/os-go-rq) to build "broad crawls" system.

As you know, Scrapy is a very popular python crawler framework. It is suit for "focused crawl": start from several URLs of specific sites, fetch html, extract and save "structured data" also with patternd links to crawl recursively. But for large scale, long time crawling especially ["broad crawls" ](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/broad-crawls.html), scrapy is not incompetent. Basically, you have to decouple the whole crawling system into several sub-systems, high-performance distributed fetcher, task scheduler, html extractor, link database, data storage and a lot of auxiliary equipments. It will be more complex when your system is for multi-tenancy.

The os-rq-scrapy and [os-go-rq](https://github.com/cfhamlet/os-go-rq) project are basic components to build "broad crawls" system. The core conceptions are very simple, os-go-rq is multi-sites request queue have http api to recieve requests. os-rq-scrapy is fetcher, getting reqests from os-go-rq and crawl multi-sites concurrently.
